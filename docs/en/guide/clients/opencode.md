# Connect OpenCode to CCX

OpenCode can connect to CCX through OpenAI Chat-compatible configuration. Use the CCX **Chat** endpoint.

## How it works

```text
OpenCode  ->  CCX /v1/chat/completions  ->  Chat channel  ->  upstream Chat-compatible endpoint
```

## 1. Configure a CCX channel

1. Open the CCX admin console and go to **Chat**
2. Click "Add Channel"
3. Add an OpenAI Chat-compatible channel

Common examples:

| Upstream | Service type | Base URL example |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| OpenAI | `OpenAI Chat` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| DeepSeek | `OpenAI Chat` | `https://api.deepseek.com` |
| GLM | `OpenAI Chat` | `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4` |
| MiniMax | `OpenAI Chat` | `https://api.minimax.io/v1` |
| Kimi | `OpenAI Chat` | `https://api.moonshot.ai/v1` |

::: tip
Model names, vision support, and special options differ by upstream. Finish the matching [provider setup guide](/en/providers/) first, then configure OpenCode.
:::

## 2. Configure OpenCode

In OpenCode, choose an OpenAI-compatible / custom provider and fill in:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| API Key | `your-ccx-proxy-key` |
| Base URL | `http://localhost:3000/v1` |
| Model | requested model name, for example `gpt-5` or `deepseek-v4-pro` |

If your OpenCode version uses a config file, the core values are still the same:

```text
API Key: your-ccx-proxy-key
Base URL: http://localhost:3000/v1
Model: your-model-name
```

::: warning
OpenCode settings screens and field names may change across versions. As long as you choose an OpenAI Chat-compatible provider, use the API Key, Base URL, and Model values above.
:::

## 3. Recommended model mapping

If OpenCode sends OpenAI-style model names but the upstream uses provider-specific names, configure model mapping on the Chat channel.

Example:

| Request model match | Example upstream model |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| `gpt` | upstream primary model |
| `mini` | upstream lightweight model |
| `deepseek` | DeepSeek model |

If you prefer OpenCode to request upstream model names directly, skip mapping and enter the actual model name in OpenCode.

## Troubleshooting

### Should Base URL be root or `/v1`?

For OpenAI Chat-compatible OpenCode setup, Base URL is usually:

```text
http://localhost:3000/v1
```

Do not point it to the concrete endpoint:

```text
http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions
```

### 401 Unauthorized

Check:

1. The OpenCode API key matches CCX `PROXY_ACCESS_KEY`
2. You did not enter the upstream provider API key
3. CCX was started with the same `PROXY_ACCESS_KEY`

### 404 or Method Not Allowed

This usually means provider type or Base URL does not match. Confirm:

1. OpenCode uses an OpenAI Chat-compatible provider
2. Base URL is `http://localhost:3000/v1`
3. CCX has a **Chat** channel, not only Messages or Responses channels

### model_not_found

Check the Chat channel:

1. The model allowlist includes the requested model or mapped upstream model
2. The model name in OpenCode matches your mapping rules
3. The upstream model name is valid

### Tool calls or multi-turn context behave unexpectedly

OpenCode uses Chat Completions. Different upstreams vary in support for tool calls, JSON output, and system messages. If compatibility issues appear:

1. Prefer an upstream with native OpenAI Chat tool-call support
2. Disable unsupported response formats or advanced model options
3. If only one upstream fails, adjust channel priority or model mapping so these requests use a more compatible channel

### Requests do not appear in Chat channel logs

Check whether the current OpenCode provider still points to another service. CCX should see this request path:

```text
/v1/chat/completions
```
